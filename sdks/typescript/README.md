# etunnel for TypeScript

[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@easytunnel/et-sdk?label=npm%20%40easytunnel%2Fet-sdk)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@easytunnel/et-sdk) (JS runtime for the same wire protocol)

Same implementation as the Node SDK, with types.

Zero registration: every SDK client speaks the same tiny wire protocol
([PROTOCOL.md](../../PROTOCOL.md)) against any etunnel server
(default `wss://t.etun.uk/tunnel`).

## Install

```
# etunnel-ts is source-only (not on npm yet):
# copy etunnel.ts into your project, or use the published JS package
npm install @easytunnel/et-sdk
```

Node >= 22 (type stripping) or tsc.

## CLI

```
node etunnel.ts 3000
```

Prints `TUNNEL_URL: https://<subdomain>.t.etun.uk` — that URL now routes to
your local service. Ctrl-C closes the tunnel.

**Reconnects automatically.** If the connection drops (including a server
restart) the CLI re-dials with exponential backoff (500ms → 30s, ±20%
jitter, reset on success) and prints `TUNNEL_URL:` again. The subdomain is
**reclaimed**, not re-randomised: the client replays the server's signed
`resumeToken` in `hello.resume`, so links already shared keep working (the
server needs a stable `SESSION_SECRET`; see PROTOCOL.md §1). Set
`ETUNNEL_RECONNECT=0` to restore the old one-shot behaviour.

## Embed

```ts
// after copying etunnel.ts next to your code:
import { connect } from './etunnel.ts';
const t = await connect('wss://t.etun.uk/tunnel', 3000);
console.log(t.url);
```

## Environment variables

| Variable | Meaning | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `ETUNNEL_SERVER` | tunnel server WebSocket URL | `wss://t.etun.uk/tunnel` |
| `ETUNNEL_LOCAL` | local port or `host:port` (or 1st CLI arg) | `3000` |
| `ETUNNEL_TOKEN` | paid-plan API key (optional) | - |
| `ETUNNEL_RECONNECT` | `0` disables auto-reconnect (one-shot CLI) | enabled |
| `ETUNNEL_SUBDOMAIN` | custom subdomain (paid plans) | random |

## License

MIT — see [LICENSE](../../LICENSE). Buffer-based protocol client: request and
response bodies are buffered per stream (fine for webhooks/dashboards/demos;
use the [Go SDK](../../sdk) for streaming and WebSocket pass-through).
