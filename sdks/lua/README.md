# etunnel for Lua

[![LuaRocks](https://img.shields.io/badge/LuaRocks-ggcode.etunnel-8b4bb8?logo=lua)](https://luarocks.org/modules/topcheer/ggcode.etunnel)

luasocket + luasec (wss against autocert servers needs lua-http for SNI).

Zero registration: every SDK client speaks the same tiny wire protocol
([PROTOCOL.md](../../PROTOCOL.md)) against any etunnel server
(default `wss://t.etun.uk/tunnel`).

## Install

```
luarocks install ggcode.etunnel
```

Requires Lua >= 5.2.

## CLI

```
lua etunnel.lua 3000
```

Prints `TUNNEL_URL: https://<subdomain>.t.etun.uk` — that URL now routes to
your local service. Ctrl-C closes the tunnel.

**Reconnects automatically.** If the connection drops (including a server
restart) the CLI re-dials with exponential backoff (500ms → 30s, ±20%
jitter, reset on success) and prints `TUNNEL_URL:` again. The subdomain is
**reclaimed**, not re-randomised: the client replays the server's signed
`resumeToken` in `hello.resume`, so links already shared keep working (the
server needs a stable `SESSION_SECRET`; see PROTOCOL.md §1). Set
`ETUNNEL_RECONNECT=0` to restore the old one-shot behaviour.

## Embed

See the header of the source file for the embed example.

## Environment variables

| Variable | Meaning | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `ETUNNEL_SERVER` | tunnel server WebSocket URL | `wss://t.etun.uk/tunnel` |
| `ETUNNEL_LOCAL` | local port or `host:port` (or 1st CLI arg) | `3000` |
| `ETUNNEL_TOKEN` | paid-plan API key (optional) | - |
| `ETUNNEL_RECONNECT` | `0` disables auto-reconnect (one-shot CLI) | enabled |

## License

MIT — see [LICENSE](../../LICENSE). Buffer-based protocol client: request and
response bodies are buffered per stream (fine for webhooks/dashboards/demos;
use the [Go SDK](../../sdk) for streaming and WebSocket pass-through).

## Service terms

Use of the etunnel relay service (default `wss://t.etun.uk/tunnel`) is governed
by its [Terms of Service](https://t.etun.uk/terms) and
[Privacy Policy](https://t.etun.uk/privacy).
