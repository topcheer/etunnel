# etunnel for C# / .NET

[![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/etunnel?label=NuGet%20etunnel)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/etunnel)

System.Net.WebSockets + HttpClient, zero NuGet dependencies.

Zero registration: every SDK client speaks the same tiny wire protocol
([PROTOCOL.md](../../PROTOCOL.md)) against any etunnel server
(default `wss://t.etun.uk/tunnel`).

## Install

```
dotnet add package etunnel
```

Requires .NET 8+ (tested on 10).

## CLI

```
dotnet run Etunnel.cs 3000
```

Prints `TUNNEL_URL: https://<subdomain>.t.etun.uk` — that URL now routes to
your local service. Ctrl-C closes the tunnel.

**Reconnects automatically.** If the connection drops (including a server
restart) the CLI re-dials with exponential backoff (500ms → 30s, ±20%
jitter, reset on success) and prints `TUNNEL_URL:` again. The subdomain is
**reclaimed**, not re-randomised: the client replays the server's signed
`resumeToken` in `hello.resume`, so links already shared keep working (the
server needs a stable `SESSION_SECRET`; see PROTOCOL.md §1). Set
`ETUNNEL_RECONNECT=0` to restore the old one-shot behaviour.

## License

MIT — see [LICENSE](../../LICENSE). Buffer-based protocol client: request and
response bodies are buffered per stream (fine for webhooks/dashboards/demos;
use the [Go SDK](../../sdk) for streaming and WebSocket pass-through).

## Service terms

Use of the etunnel relay service (default `wss://t.etun.uk/tunnel`) is governed
by its [Terms of Service](https://t.etun.uk/terms) and
[Privacy Policy](https://t.etun.uk/privacy).
